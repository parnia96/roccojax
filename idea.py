# CONNECT GAME IMPLEMENTATION
# ---------------------------
'''
connect game in python.
it'll listen to the player which he/she said a SilentPhonetic
then this bot will give us a word using DRL model
in which its two first letter match with the player's letters
that he/she just said. after making a connection to someone
this bot will counting in a reverse manner and say the word. 
this bot should connect to other players in such a way that 
defeat the player in first round!  
we need a pattern to read other players mind to know their
manners, behaviours and thoughts with this bot
we need to get the players voice then convert them into words

        TODO: use presentation tools in my phone to control my conferences using the phone + also use airdroid to control the phone with my lap top on LAN
        TODO: find a good app to create my vocfu style slides for all about Machine/deep Learning(ANN) vs data mining in AI and my idearuning
        TOKNOW: understand the graphical computational model of Tensorflow and its ANN
        TOKNOW: data mining and big data concepts and their algorithms + matrices and graph concepts to know the entire algorithm + oneirology

        tools: open source kits and hardwares(Raspberry Pi) to fire up the machine or maybe we want to use quantum computing machine
        tools: blockchain truffle COP to create contracts between dreams using their public address key 
        tools: ANN tensorFlow(python) for its machine(deep) learning in AI section to create images of objects and events in dream using recorded brain waves and reverse engineering 
        tools: graph DB neo4j(nodejs/python) to store all objects in every dream or we can use IPFS or storj => decentralized and distributed storage(BlockchainTech folder)

    proof-of-Brain's_Password_Cracker-idea => Build A Device Like Specific Neurons Using ANN To Detect The Words & Phrases Or Read Whole Things Of Mind And Save Them In A Safe TXT File Or We Can Send Them By Wifi Or A New Protocol In A Second When User Is Typing The Credentials; User's Brain Must Know This Device As Our Arbitary(Specific) Neuron To Give The Data To Our
    Device Using Brain's And Device's Synapses, Maybe We Have To Use Quantum Computing Machine; we can use IPFS or storj => decentralized and distributed storage(BlockchainTech folder)
    	CONCEPTS: simulation, iot concept, probabilistic
    	programming languages: python + ethereum stack
	AI-TYPE : Artificial Super Intelligence

    proof-of-Doublegainer-idea => Build A Virtual Brain From The Real One Which Is The Human Brain In Order To Do All Remaining Stuffs And Works Of Human Life That Is related To Another BlockchainTechs + its Dapp with ethereum stack:
        CONCEPTS: simulation, iot concept, probabilistic
        TO NEED: we need a blockchain based storage like sia for our contracts between the human brain and the virtual one to store rapidly the data and transactions in blockchain
        programming languages: python + ethereum stack
        references: https://blog.sia.tech/how-to-put-data-on-the-sia-network-784499a65b, http://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/simpy_intro/, https://pypi.python.org/pypi/simpy
        TODO: we can use IPFS or storj => decentralized and distributed storage(BlockchainTech folder)
        TODO: build a device to act like neuron to get the data from real brain using its synapses and send them to the virtual brain
        TODO: virtual brain must check the ownership of neuron device using its UUID or a unique behaviour address
        TODO: the virtual brain collect data into different categories like emotion works; logical works; anger works and so on using ANN or AI
        TODO: then virtual brain stores all categories which every category has its own works in our blockchain and all works have a public address in order to interact with each others and 		other categories using smart contracts with truffle and COP concept
        TODO: create your neural networks
        TODO: add citizen ship idea(AI blockchain based using smart contract with validithum as its crypto crurrency money to create a smart citizen and change the constitution)
        TODO: for its proof of work we have some systems for our users which are the nodes in our entire network and check two rules for the incoming data from our neuron device:
              check the ownership of virtual brain so every real brain must hav UUID(or a unique address of our neuron device stuck(later on we can use brain waves to detect the thoughts of real brain and send those waves to our virtual brain without using a neuron device) on users brain)
              either is a new or old data if is new it will added to the blockchain with its category and real brain info like its address and its waves; if is old the virtual brain must detect the rest of work or what was the final result of that using ANN or AI
        PURPOSE: we want to build another human not a robot ofcourse but a virtual brain which it will do all human works and make all human decisions according to the order of human real
        	     brain; the human brain must active the virtual mode with a kind of signal or some orders or some thoughts(brain waves thoughts)
        PURPOSE: this technology is usefull for interacting with other blockchain and distributed systems to have copy of a human brain and make presence of human less in computer world
        		 we can use it in mental payment system, book writing & create movie or make a new language from user's mind using ANN or AI concept to show the right concept of what he/she is thinking or imagining to the other people or other blockchain system finally write your about-me book!
